On this project I feel as though I implemented the useState hook and the useEffect as much as i possibly could. Although I was getting a little overwhelmed at first when it came to actually getting everything to work on my page and after coming accross plenty of errors. I was sturggling to get my button functions working but I did however look through the react website and the past workshops to help me understand better and also asking my peers throughout the time and collaborating together helped me alot better. I also came accross another website which helped me use a 'previous state' function which helped me achieve what I initially wanted my buttons to do. Overall, this assignment wasnt as easy as I thought it would be, I still feel as though I could implement more in the overall app such as using local storage if I had more time to do so.
